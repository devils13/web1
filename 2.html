<p>There has been a strong reaction to the court’s rejection of <a href="https://news.google.com/?tab=rn&hl=en-AU&gl=AU&ceid=AU:en" target="_blank" title="Google News George Pell">George Pell’s</a> appeal of his guilty sentence to child sex offences,
but the disgraced cardinal still has his supporters.
Controversial columnist Andrew Bolt has written in his blog for the Herald Sun that he is “appalled”
by the dismissal of Pell’s appeal.</P>

<p style="margin-top:25px;">Pell, one of Australia’s most high profile Catholics, and the former treasurer for the Vatican, was convicted of five charges of
sexually assaulting choirboys in December last year. The five charges included the rape of one choirboy, 13,
and sexual assault of another at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996.
Bolt, a Melbourne-based columnist who has previously expressed his cynicism over the victim’s accounts,
said there were a number of “improbabilities” in the case.
“Even if Pell could physically have been in the sacristy, in time, and without being seen, and physically
done these attacks, how insane would he have to be to do all this, attack two boys he didn’t know, in an open room in a busy
cathedral?” Bolt wrote on his Herald Sun blog after today’s verdict.</p>
